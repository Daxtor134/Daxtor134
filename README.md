# Welcome to my profile

Hi and welcome to my humble profile. My name is James but I prefer to be called **Daxtor** or **Dax**. Currently, at the time of writing this, I have
been programming for a little over 10-years :alarm_clock:. I thoroughly enjoy programming as a hobby and currently am planning out some new projects.
Maybe starting a YouTube channel making Dev Vlogs ands other fun stuff, but that is down the road.

Currently the project idea that I am thinking about most is making a game engine for a fun side project that would be long term. Not only that it
provides some good video content for YouTube as well. But that is all just penciled out planning for the future.

## My current favorite Programming Languages & Frameworks

My current favorite programming languages and frameworks have to be:

1. Python
2. C/C++
3. C#

For the ones that I use the most. But those are not the only ones that I use though. For some of the ones that I am interested in but not have taken
the time to learn are Rust. Rust is actually pretty awesome as it can function alongside JavaScript and work for building insanely fast web applications
and so much more.

React has to be favorite front-end framework when it comes to Node.js as it is fast and effecient and in my humble opinion way cleaner than Angular.
Having used Angular switching over was actually pretty nice.

## Current Projects

Currently the projects that I am working on are Private, sorry.
